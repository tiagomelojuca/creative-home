# creative-home
Creative Home is a simple web application for storing and sharing ideas of things to do at home in this particular and difficult moment we are living due to COVID-19.

This little project was developed during the Rocketseat's workshop over their Omnistack Week #11, just for portfolio purposes, and the application's concept was totally theirs. Front-end was made just with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Back-end, otherwise, was constructed over a NodeJS server with Express for dealing with HTTP requisitons, SQLite for the database, and Nunjucks as template engine.

### Improvements
Even with workshop focusing just in desktop view of the application due to short time it had, I also made it responsive. This way, I think that, even in it's own little scope, this small application could be used as inspiration to create something nice. So, feel free to study the code and use it as a starting point to "put your own idea in the web" (sorry, it was a bad joke, it wasn't? haha). Oh, and feel free to do a Pull Request with any suggestions for making the code better. I would appreciate a lot, and every constructive review will be welcome.
